# Builder Design Pattern

In the Builder Pattern there is a director and a builder, which work together to build an object. The director controls the building and specifies what parts and variations will go into an object. The builder knows how to assemble the object given specification. 

## Description

The use case of this project is based on a builder design pattern example from [Domnikl](https://github.com/domnikl/DesignPatternsPHP/tree/main/Creational). Imagine you have to build a Car or a Truck vehicle, which is a complex object, composed with many parts. You will see a example using and not using builder design pattern.

## Usage

If you would like to test you just have to execute the command below

```bash
php app.php
```
